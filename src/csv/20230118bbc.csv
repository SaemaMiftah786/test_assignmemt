"By James Waterhouse in Brovary, and Paul Kirby in London",Ukraine's interior ministry leadership killed in helicopter crash,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64315594,"/nThis video can not be played/nWatch: Scene of devastation after Brovary helicopter crash/nThe three main figures in Ukraine's interior ministry have been killed in a helicopter crash beside a nursery in an eastern suburb of the capital Kyiv./nInterior Minister Denys Monastyrsky, 42, died alongside his first deputy minister and state secretary./nFourteen people died when the helicopter came down in Brovary around 08:30 local time (06:30 GMT), including one child, authorities said./nThere is no indication the crash was anything other than an accident./nBut the SBU state security service said it was following several possible causes for the crash, which included sabotage as well as a technical malfunction or breach of flight rules./nThe helicopter came down near a kindergarten building which was left badly damaged and blackened by smoke./nThe State Emergency Service had previously stated that up to 18 people were killed but later revised the death toll from the crash, saying 14 had died./nMr Monastyrsky, who was one of President Volodymyr Zelensky's longest serving political advisers, is the highest profile Ukrainian casualty since the war began./nThe deputy head of Ukraine's presidential office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said the minister had been travelling to a war ""hot spot"" when his helicopter went down./nThe head of police in the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, Volodymyr Tymoshko, said the ministerial team were on their way to meet him there and he had spoken to them only yesterday./nThe minister's death cuts to the heart of the government in Kyiv as the interior ministry has the vital task of maintaining security and running the police during the war./nAppearing via video-link at the World Economic Forum in Davos, President Zelensky asked leaders to observe a minute of silence for the lives lost in the helicopter crash, and later added ""there are no accidents at war time. These are all war results absolutely.""/nThe Ukrainian president added that he was not concerned for his own safety./nThe head of Ukraine's national police force, Ihor Klymenko, has been appointed acting interior minister following Mr Monastyrsky's death./nWitnesses in Kyiv said Russia's war was to blame for the disaster./n""It was very foggy and there was no electricity, and when there's no electricity there are no lights on the buildings,"" local resident Volodymyr Yermelenko told the BBC./nKey officials are flown by helicopter across Ukraine at tree-level, but that comes with risks./nAll that was recognisable of the helicopter was a door panel and one of its rotors which landed on the roof of a car. Next to it were three bodies covered in foil blankets./nThe 42-year-old interior minister was a prominent member of President Zelensky's cabinet./nHe was a recognisable face for Ukrainians throughout the war, updating the public on casualties caused by Russian missile strikes since Ukraine was invaded in February 2022./nUkrainian officials said those on board the helicopter included six ministry officials and three crew./nFirst deputy minister Yevhen Yenin died along with state secretary Yuriy Lubkovych, whose task was to organise the work of the ministry./nBefore he moved to the interior ministry, Mr Yenin helped represent Ukraine's government abroad./nUS President Joe Biden expressed his condolences to all victims of the crash./nMr Tymoshenko said the interior ministry's work would not be affected by the loss of its leaders, but government colleagues were visibly shocked as they reacted on national TV./nA friend of the late minister's, MP Mariia Mezentseva, said it was a tragedy for everyone as the ministry had a significant role in Ukraine's response to the invasion./n""He responded 24/7 to his colleagues, friends and family. He was very close to President Zelensky from day one of his presidential campaign,"" she told the BBC./nThe national police chief Mr Kylmenko wrote on Facebook that the helicopter belonged to Ukraine's state emergency service, while other officials said it appeared to a be a French Super Puma aircraft./nParents were bringing their children to the kindergarten before going to work when the helicopter came down./n""The pain is unspeakable,"" the president said. ""The helicopter fell on the territory of one of the kindergartens.""/nMany of the casualties were on the ground. As well as the child that was killed, 11 of the 25 injured on the ground were youngsters./nWitnesses said the pilot had tried to avoid high-rise buildings before the crash, and instead went down near the kindergarten./nOne local woman told the BBC that she had seen a terrible flash as the helicopter circled above her home. The pilot had clearly tried to avoid her 10-storey block of flats and chose to go down closer to the smaller building, she said./n""Parents were running, screaming. There was panic,"" said local volunteer Lidiya. Emergency services and residents rushed to evacuate the children as fire spread through the nursery building./nResident Dmytro described jumping over a fence to help get children out. One girl he picked up was called Polina, but when her father ran in calling her name he did not recognise her as her face was covered in blood./nTetiana Shutiak, an aide to Mr Monastyrskyi, also died in the crash./nInterior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said the three men were friends and statesmen who had worked to make Ukraine stronger./n""We will always remember you. Your families will be cared for,"" he said on Facebook./nMs Mezentseva said she had initially thought that the disaster was fake news: ""But unfortunately it's true.""/nIt was only four days ago that Ukraine was hit by one of the worst attacks since the start of the war in which 45 civilians were killed./nA Russian missile hit a block of flats in the central city of Dnipro killing 45 people, including six children./nUkraine has appealed to the West to provide tanks to help respond to any expected new Russian offensive./nA decision is likely to be made later this week when Western allies discuss the war at Ramstein air base in Germany./n© 2023 BBC.

By Karishma Vaswani,"Maria Ressa: Truth and justice won today, says Nobel laureate",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-64315409,"/nMaria Ressa looks and sounds like she is on top of the world, and understandably so - this has been a huge victory for her./nA court in the Philippines has acquitted the journalist and her news outlet Rappler of tax evasion, in a move hailed as a win for press freedom./nIn an interview for the BBC, she talks about what she calls the ""weaponisation of the law"" against her - and how it took more than four years to get to this point./n""This is a day that we had hoped would happen sooner,"" she told me over zoom from Manila - beaming smiles as she spoke./n""And you know, it went down to these three things, facts, truth and justice. That is who won today.""/nUnder former president Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippine government had accused Ms Ressa and Rappler of evading tax payments when it raised capital through its partnership with foreign investors. Ms Ressa and Rappler denied the charges./nRappler had been one of the few Philippine media organisations to be openly critical of Mr Duterte and his policies./nThe Philippines' National Union of Journalists said the tax evasion case reflected an increasing use of law for reprisal and intimidation against journalists and civil society./nBut it hasn't been an easy road, and there's still a tough battle ahead. Ms Ressa is acutely aware of the trials she has yet to face, but draws her inspiration from those who have gone before her./n""You know, Martin Luther King says, yes - it will take time,"" she said. ""But as I was reading through the decision, and there was no reason to take us to court... we're not tax evaders - we never were… This was an incredibly important day because it would have set a direction for which way the Philippines was going.""/nMaria Ressa's legal problems started while Mr Duterte's administration was in power, and continued into the current President Ferdinand Marcos Junior's time./nDoes she think things are changing now, under his rule?/n""Our president is in Davos today speaking to business leaders,"" she muses. ""So it is, it's a great signal to bring about where the Philippines is. We still have a ways to go - the fight isn't over. And can I go to jail? I hope not. I'll knock on wood, you know, but I was ready for either decision.""/nIt's clear that Maria Ressa is up for the fight - she still has several cases against her, and faces significant prison sentences for them - those legal challenges are looming./nThe last four years have taken their toll on her family, especially her parents. But as she puts it, it's par for the course in this job./n""It's like being in a conflict area - being in a war zone. It's just long, right?""/nMs Ressa's enthusiasm and optimism are infectious - but behind the beaming smiles and much deserved relief is a palpable sense of injustice./nThis is not just directed at the system that could have potentially put her behind bars, but at social media firms that she feels are partially to blame for the scourge of fake news in the Philippines - something she says is responsible for so many of the country's problems today./n""The world as we knew it has been completely destroyed,"" she tells me. ""Are you on TikTok? Because I talk about Facebook as a mallet for our minds, but TikTok as a surgical probe./n""Imagine if you're in high school and you're trying to curate your life for a feed… that could turn into a mob… What types of values do you have? I worry about the next generation.""/nSo what would she say to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg if she could sit down with him face to face?/nMs Ressa doesn't miss a beat./n""Draw your lines, Mark,"" she exclaims. ""In America… you prioritise your shareholders. But there is a line between amoral, immoral and evil. And you have to know when when you cross those lines, when what you have created inspires autocracy, and fascism inspires violence, enables genocide.""/n© 2023 BBC.

,Iranian man who beheaded 17-year-old wife jailed for eight years,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-64319487,"/nA man who beheaded his 17-year-old wife has been sentenced to eight years in prison in Iran, the judiciary says./nImages of Sajjad Heydari carrying Mona's severed head in Ahvaz after the so-called ""honour killing"" last year caused widespread outrage./nA judiciary spokesman said the leniency of the sentence was due to Mona's parents having ""pardoned"" him for the murder rather than seeking retribution./nHer father previously said that he had not given his consent for the killing./nMona had been married to her husband since the age of 12 and had given birth to their son when she was only 14./nLocal media reported that she had fled to Turkey after allegedly being subjected to domestic violence by her husband, who had refused her requests for a divorce./nShe had returned to Iran a few days before her murder last February because she had reportedly received assurances from her family that she would be safe./nJudiciary spokesman Massoud Setayeshi told reporters on Wednesday that Sajjad Heydari had been sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison for murder and an additional eight months for assault./nHe explained that the verdict was in line with Iranian law, under which intentional murder is punishable by death unless the family of the victim forgives the killer./nMona's brother-in-law was given a 45-month sentence for complicity in the murder, he said./nThe gruesome killing prompted fresh demands in Iran for a law aimed at preventing domestic violence and protecting victims./nThere were also calls for the minimum age of marriage for children to be raised. It is currently set at 13 for girls, although girls even younger than that can legally marry with judicial and parental consent./nIn 2020, there was similar outrage after 14-year-old Romina Ashrafi was beheaded by her father after she reportedly ran away from home with her boyfriend. The father, who had consulted a lawyer to find out what punishment he could face for the crime before he killed her, was sentenced to nine years in prison - one less than the maximum allowed under the law./nThe government subsequently approved a draft law that would criminalise various forms of violence against women. However, it has yet to be passed by parliament and a UN independent expert has said it does not go far enough./nIran is currently being rocked by anti-government protests that were sparked by the death in custody of a young woman who was detained by morality police in September for allegedly wearing her hijab, or headscarf, ""improperly""./nFour people have so far been executed in connection with the protests, while 18 others have been sentenced to death. Human rights groups have said they were convicted after grossly unfair sham trials./n© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

By Grace Tsoi,Alvin Chau: Macau gambling kingpin jailed for 18 years,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-64314043,"/nMacau gambling kingpin Alvin Chau has been sentenced to 18 years in jail for more than 100 charges including organised crime and illegal gaming./nThe 48-year-old was found guilty in a case that centred on illegal bets exceeding HK$823.7bn (£85.7bn; $105bn)./nChau, a high-profile and colourful figure in the local casino industry, had denied the charges./nMacau, a former Portuguese colony, is the only Chinese city where casino gambling is legal./nChau was the chairman and founder of Suncity Group. It was Macau's biggest operator of junkets, or organised trips for wealthy gamblers to casinos./nIt arranged for high rollers from mainland China to travel to Macau and gamble in the city's casinos, and offered loans to them. It also collected debts for casinos, and operated VIP rooms across Macau's casinos./nThe businessman, nicknamed ""Junket King"", resigned in December 2021 days after his arrest./nProsecutors had accused Chau of creating and leading a criminal syndicate that had facilitated undeclared bets. They said that as a result the government lost more than HK$8.26bn in tax income./nThe court ruled in favour of the prosecutors for most of the charges, but acquitted Chau of money laundering. The high-profile case also involves 20 other defendants./nThe gambling industry has been hit hard by coronavirus restrictions as well as a crackdown by the Chinese government's on money being moved out of the mainland./nIn September, a court in the eastern Chinese city of Wenzhou jailed more than 30 people for cross-border gambling in connection with Chau's case./nSuncity shut all of its VIP rooms after Chau's arrest. But even before that the number of junkets in Macau had been on constant decline. There are now only 36 junket operators left, down from 100 in 2019, according to official figures./nWith his slicked-back hair and tanned skin, Chau is a well-known figure in the Chinese-speaking world and a favourite among tabloids which have focused on his love affairs./nLocal media labelled him 'Washing Rice Wa"" after a sitcom character - though the name can also be seen as an euphemism for money laundering./n© 2023 BBC.

The animals have a low lethal temperature, and were thought start ""dropping dead"" at about 35 degrees, she says./n""But in our study, we found them out and about - active, foraging and looking just fine - at ambient temperatures of 37.5 degrees.""/n""They are probably one of our more heat intolerance species, but we're finding that they're not as hopeless as they are supposed to be... and now we have a mechanism by how they might be managing this.""/n© 2023 BBC.

A food adviser says workers should not bring in sweet treats - to avoid tempting colleagues./nFood Standards Agency chairwoman Prof Susan Jebb compared being around cake in the office to passive smoking./nShe said: ""If nobody brought cakes into the office, I would not eat cakes.""/nInterviewed by the Times newspaper, and speaking in a personal capacity, she said workers should stop testing the willpower of colleagues./nBut speaking to the BBC, GP Dr Helen Wall said people had to take responsibility for their own health./nThe family doctor who practises in Bolton said: ""If someone's got a cake next to you, you don't have to eat it, do you?""/nProf Jebb, also a professor of diet and population at the University of Oxford, said eating cake was a choice but colleagues could help each other by providing ""a supportive environment""./nShe argued that being around cake in the office was like passive smoking, which though not identical also inflicted harm on others./nLou Walker, who authored a report on office cake culture, told BBC 5 Live that it was becoming an everyday occurrence and was ""no longer special""./n""[It] comes from a place of generosity and kindness, wanting to share,"" she said. ""There's something very important about sharing food with colleagues./n""But what is happening now is it's happening every single day and that means that it's no longer special.""/nShe said her research showed people ""aren't wanting it all the time, but people are worried about sticking their head above the parapet.""/nIn many workplaces cake, biscuits and sweets - brought by colleagues returning from holiday or to celebrate last days and birthdays - can start a scramble as hungry and sweet-toothed colleagues try to get their hands on the treats./nIt is a rare workplace that breaks the tradition and supplies a fruit platter. And who wants to be known as the one staff member who brings in healthy nuts rather than chocolates as they regale colleagues about their weekend in Switzerland?/nDr Wall said it was fine to have some pleasures in the workplace./nSpeaking on BBC Breakfast, she said: ""It does feel like we're trying to control everything. At the end of the day you've got to have a little bit of willpower.""/nFor one worker, a love of sweet treats in the office did not go down well with his colleagues./nWhile temping in an office in south London, Mick used to bring in biscuits, doughnuts, and chocolate bar multipacks, which he would ""munch on"" all day as well offering them out./nBut he claimed he was told by management his diet was ""aggressive"" to his female co-workers who were trying to be health conscious./n""The ladies would say 'no, they're watching their weight',"" he said./nAs to the government's official position, the prime minister's official spokesman said Rishi Sunak believed ""personal choice should be baked into our approach""./nHe added: ""We want to encourage healthy lifestyles and are taking action to tackle obesity, which has cost the NHS £6bn annually./n""However, the way to deal with this issue is not to stop people from occasionally bringing in treats for their co-workers.""/nMr Sunak's spokesman added that the prime minister was ""very partial to a piece of cake"" and most enjoyed carrot and red velvet cake./nAccording to the NHS website, a majority of adults in England are overweight. Regularly consuming foods and drinks high in sugar increases your risk of obesity and tooth decay./nThe Food Standards Agency is responsible for food safety and food hygiene in England, Wales and Northern Ireland./nProf Jebb, who is on the Times Health Commission, a year-long inquiry by the paper into the future of health and social care in the UK, expressed frustration at ministers' decision to delay the introduction of a TV watershed for junk food advertising./nThe Department of Health said the plans would be deferred for a year while officials assessed the impact on household finances as families struggled with the increasing cost of living./nShare your experiences.

By Michael Race,Chancellor Jeremy Hunt branded 'Mr Bean' for video,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64315850,"/nChancellor Jeremy Hunt has been compared to Mr Bean over a social media video in which he uses coffee cups to explain inflation./nIn the video, Mr Hunt orders a flat white before explaining what he is doing to tackle rising prices./nHe says a cup of coffee a year ago was around £2.50, but is now £3. He then sets out the reasons for high inflation, such as the war in Ukraine./nBoth Labour and Liberal Democrats criticised the chancellor's video./nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has pledged to halve inflation this year but many expect this to happen anyway largely due to a slowdown in energy price rises and as post-pandemic supply problems ease./nThe government's official independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) expects inflation, which measures the rate of price rises, to fall to 3.75%  by the end of this year - well below half the current level./nAnd the Bank of England expects it to drop to around 5%. The Bank's target rate is 2%./nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the expected fall in inflation ""does not have much to do with government policies""./nInstead, he said it would largely be driven by the fall in commodity prices and shipping costs over the last six months working its way through to prices for food and other goods, along with energy bills starting to fall back in the second half of this year./n""They [government] will be able to take some credit if they stand firm on public sector pay rises, but this is just one relatively small part of the overall puzzle,"" he said. ""The biggest driver of the fall in inflation will be global developments in food, energy and goods prices.""/nThe video was released after the latest inflation figures were released early on Wednesday./nAlthough price rises slowed for a second month in a row, the cost of food including milk, cheese and eggs kept inflation close to a 40-year high of 10.5% in the year to December./nSarah Olney, the Lib Dems' Treasury spokesperson, said the ""last thing"" families needed was a ""Mr Bean-esque video"" from the Conservative party./n""What's even more shocking is that Jeremy Hunt airbrushed one of the main causes of economic pain - Liz Truss' disastrous mini-budget that resulted in the biggest tax hike for a generation,"" she added./n""How is that supposed to help Britain with inflation?""/nA Labour source added: ""The chancellors 'not me guv' explainer misses out the fundamental fact that the British public have been so exposed to economic shocks and the energy crisis because of 13 years of Tory failure.""/nIn the video, posted on early Wednesday, Mr Hunt explains there are ""lots of reasons"" inflation has gone up, citing Covid, and the war in Ukraine pushing up food and energy prices./n""All that means is the price of a cup of coffee has gone up,"" he adds./nMr Hunt says the government is investing in renewable and nuclear energy and energy efficient programmes as well as taking ""difficult decisions to balance the nation's books"" to ""halve inflation""./n""That's what's happening, and that's our plan"", he adds./nIn response to the clip, Fraser Nelson, editor of the Spectator magazine, tweeted: ""I wonder if Hunt explains that a Chancellor has no real power over inflation - and that it's expected to halve in France, Germany, US, Canada, Israel & more./n""None of whose finance ministers are trying to take credit for this global trends.""/nAnother user responded: ""Who makes these? The script, camera angles, editing and even lens choices come together to create a condescending, mid-20th-century didactic tone.""/nFormer Education Secretary Kit Malthouse also appeared to question the content of the message with the comment: ""Money supply?""/n© 2023 BBC.

Human rights groups have said they were convicted after grossly unfair sham trials./nMohammad Mehdi Karami, a 22-year-old karate champion, was hanged on 7 January, just 65 days after his arrest./nSources have told BBC Persian that he had less than 15 minutes to defend himself in court./nHis story shows how authorities in Iran are using show trials to strike fear into the hearts of the protesters, who are demanding freedom and an end to the clerical regime./nThe protest movement began after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who was detained by morality police in September for allegedly not wearing the mandatory headscarf ""properly""./nAuthorities dismissed the unrest as ""rioting"" and launched a violent crackdown. At least 481 protesters have been killed by security forces, according to Iran Human Rights, a Norway-based non-governmental organisation./nKarami was arrested in connection with the murder of a member of the paramilitary Basij force during protests in the city of Karaj, just west of Tehran, on 3 November./nHe was later charged with the capital offence of ""corruption on Earth"" and went on trial before a Revolutionary Court in Karaj on 30 November along with 16 other people, including three children, also accused of involvement in the murder./nDefendants are entitled to legal representation in Iran, but in sensitive cases like this one, or in espionage cases, they are not allowed to choose their own lawyers. Instead, the court appoints one from a list approved by the judiciary./nJournalists and members of the defendant's family are also barred from being in court, so the only window into what happens behind the closed doors is heavily edited footage released by the judiciary./nIn one such video, Karami appears visibly distressed as he ""confesses"" to hitting the Basij member on the head with a rock. His court-appointed lawyer does not challenge or dispute this and, instead, asks the judge for forgiveness. Karami then says he was ""fooled"" and sits down./nOn 5 December, Karami was convicted and sentenced to death. Four of his co-defendants were also sentenced to death, while the children and eight others were handed lengthy jail terms, according to the judiciary./nNormally, defendants' family members come under pressure from authorities to stay silent./nBut Mohammad's father, Mashaalah Karami, who works as a street vendor selling packets of tissues, gave an interview to the Etemad newspaper. He said his son had called him in tears the day that he was sentenced to death./n""Dad, they gave us the verdict. Mine is the death penalty. Don't tell Mum anything,"" his father recalled, reiterating his son's innocence./nLater, opposition activist group 1500 Tasvir published an account on social media alleging that Karami had been tortured./nIt said he had told his family during a meeting in prison that he had been beaten unconscious by guards. The guards had assumed he was dead and dumped his body in a remote area, but as they left they had realised he was still alive, it added./nKarami also told his family that security agents had ""touched his genitals every day and threatened to rape him"" during interrogations, according to the account./nUnder Iran's legal system, when a lower court passes a death sentence it is sent to the Supreme Court for approval. But even if the Supreme Court endorses the death penalty, it can still be appealed./nKarami's father told Etemad that he had tried to contact the state-appointed lawyer multiple times, but there had been no response./nThe family then tried to hire one of Iran's most prominent human rights lawyers, Mohammad Hossein Aghasi./n""Mohammad called me from prison three times and asked me to represent him. His parents also urged me to represent their son,"" Mr Aghasi said./nMr Aghasi wrote to the local court and then to the Supreme Court. At every stage, his letters were ignored or rejected. And lodging an appeal against the Supreme Court decision was also ruled out by a judge./nAuthorities have repeatedly said the fast-track trials of protesters and the harsh sentences handed out are meant as a deterrent./nSeyed Mohammad Hosseini, a 39-year-old volunteer children's coach, was also hanged on 7 January, after standing trial alongside Karami for the same crime./nHis parents are dead, so there was no family-led campaign on social media to save his life after he was sentenced. However, many Iranians shared a post saying: ""We are all Mohammad's family.""/nHosseini, who was bipolar, did manage to get independent legal representation after the Supreme Court had upheld his death sentence./nLawyer Ali Sharifzadeh Ardakani was able to visit him in prison in December and later tweeted about it./n""He cried throughout the visit.

By Laura Gozzi in London & Davide Ghiglione in Rome,Matteo Messina Denaro: How Mafia boss was caught on a visit to a clinic,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64302105,"/nThis video can not be played/nWATCH: Moment Matteo Messina Denaro is detained in Palermo, Sicily/nItaly's most wanted mobster was heading to a cafe outside a private Sicilian clinic when a policeman approached him and asked him his name./nHe did not lie./nHe merely looked up and said: ""You know who I am. I am Matteo Messina Denaro.""/nUntil that moment, the armed forces could not be sure the man really was the Mafia ""boss of all bosses"", who they had been hunting for three decades./nHe checked in for an appointment at the clinic under the name of Andrea Bonafede./nBut after years of painstaking research, and only a computerised image to go on, Italy's Carabinieri military police were confident enough he was the man they were looking for./nDuring his time at the top of the Cosa Nostra organised crime syndicate, Messina Denaro oversaw racketeering, illegal waste dumping, money-laundering and drug-trafficking. He was convicted in absentia in 2002 of a string of murders./nHe was reportedly the protege of Totò Riina, head of the Corleone clan, who was arrested in 1993 after 23 years on the run./nThat was also the year that Messina Denaro vanished. For 30 years investigators could rely only on a facial composite and short snippets of voice recordings to identify him./nReported sightings placed him everywhere from Venezuela to the Netherlands. But it was in Palermo - the heart of his homeland of Sicily - that he was caught./n""It took so long to arrest him because, as it happened with other Mafia bosses, he was protected by a very dense network of complicities, deeply-rooted and extremely powerful in Sicily and beyond,"" Italian journalist Andrea Purgatori told the BBC./nMany had assumed Monday's arrest was the result of a tip-off by Messina Denaro's associates, who decided the ailing boss was no longer useful to them./nAfter all, for a long time Italy's most-wanted mafioso had felt protected enough ""to walk freely in the streets of Palermo, the moral capital of Cosa Nostra,"" said Mr Purgatori./nIn the end he was found in the centre of a busy city: hardly a hidden spot. After 30 years of searching, what had finally led the police to him?/nAt a news conference, police dismissed the theory of a tip-off. Instead, they said they had combined old-school investigative methods with modern technology to narrow down their suspects./n""Over the years, a sort of smokescreen formed around Messina Denaro, made up of a network of people loyal to him,"" said Mitja Gialuz, lawyer and professor of criminal procedure at LUISS University in Rome./nFor over a decade, police cracked down on anyone suspected of protecting or aiding Messina Denaro. More than 100 people were arrested, including Denaro's siblings, and businesses worth over €150m (£130m) were seized./n""This gradually weakened his network and… eventually made him more vulnerable,"" said Gen Teo Luzi. The smokescreen had started to clear./nMeanwhile, the homes of Messina Denaro's relatives were wiretapped./nThey must have been aware that their conversations were being listened to, and so only talked about ""people with cancer"" and ""cancer surgeries"" in generic terms./nYet that was enough to tip investigators off - especially due to longstanding rumours that Messina Denaro was sick./nThese intercepts, combined with monitoring of internet searches on Crohn's disease and liver cancer by Messina Denaro's associates, led the Carabinieri to assume the Mafia boss was seeking treatment./nThey then gathered the details of all male cancer patients born in 1962 near Trapani, in western Sicily. Investigators zoomed into their lives, narrowing down the search to 10 suspects, then five./nOne name jumped out at them: Andrea Bonafede, the nephew of deceased Mafia boss Leonardo Bonafede./nA man identifying as Bonafede is said to have had surgery in Palermo twice, in 2020 and 2021. But phone-mapping put the real Bonafede's phone far away from the Sicilian capital on one of the two days he apparently went under the knife./nWhen a chemotherapy session was booked under his name, the Carabinieri knew it was their chance. On Monday morning, more than 100 members of the armed forces surrounded La Maddalena clinic./nMessina Denaro was walking to a cafe when he noticed the heavy police presence. He made to turn back, but spotted more police closing off the street. He didn't run. Perhaps he, too, had known it was just a matter of time./nOne of the officers, Col Lucio Arcidiacono, told Italy's TGcom24 he had hunted Messina Denaro for eight years and ""felt a surge of emotion"" when he saw him in the flesh. ""It was him - the man in the photographs I'd seen so many times.""/nThe Mafia boss - who was reportedly ""polite and soft-spoken"" - was taken to a nearby airport and flown overnight to a high-security penitentiary in L'Aquila, in the central region of Abruzzo, by military plane./nDetails of how Messina Denaro lived before his arrest are now starting to emerge. He was living in an unassuming house in Campobello di Mazara, 116km from Palermo and a mere 8km from his birthplace of Castelvetrano./nA neighbour told Italian TV that he frequently saw the man and that they would greet one another regularly./nPolice found no weapons in the hideout, according to initial reports, but rather luxury perfumes, expensive furniture and designer clothes./nMessina Denaro's taste for high-end items was well-known. When he was arrested, he was reportedly wearing a watch worth €35,000. Police said that far from looking like a ""destroyed man"", he seemed like ""a well-groomed man in a good economic condition""./nWhile he was a source of frustration for authorities and his victims' families, the fact that it took authorities so long to catch Messina Denaro fuelled his myth, said Prof Gialuz./n""Of course, he was forced to live extremely cautiously, and had to calculate every move to perfection.""/nHis associates' internet searches may have contributed to Messina Denaro's arrest, but it is unlikely the boss himself ever used technology because of the risk of leaving digital traces./n""A Mafia boss, in order to continue to operate undisturbed, has to stay away from technology, and return to an almost primitive way of life, going back to the roots of verbal communication, and creating a parallel and sophisticated secret code of communication with his allies,"" Prof Gialuz explained./nItalians have been transfixed by the arrest. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni flew straight to Sicily to congratulate the armed forces as praise poured in from all sides of the political spectrum./n""Messina Denaro was the last godfather of the most ferocious generation of mafiosi. After he went into hiding, Cosa Nostra completely changed its attitude, becoming a more silent and almost invisible, submerged organisation,"" journalist Andrea Purgatori told the BBC./nThe mobster once boasted he could fill a cemetery with his victims. Mr Purgatori said until the 1990s, murders were being committed on a daily basis./n""Messina Denaro committed some of the most violent and cruel crimes Italy can remember,"" he said. In 2002 he was tried and sentenced to life in jail in absentia. His murders include:/nUniversity of Essex criminology professor Anna Sergi told the BBC it was doubtful Cosa Nostra could survive without its mythological boss, who had become the symbol of the Mafia's resilience./n""Who is going to take over - or indeed if anyone can - remains to be seen,"" she said./n© 2023 BBC.

By Matt Murphy,Andrey Medvedev: How Russian mercenary says he made an icy escape to Norway,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64303652,"/nAs Andrey Medvedev dashed towards the remote Russia-Norway border, he claims he could hear the sound of attack dogs snarling behind him./nTheir arrival, he says, meant the men hunting him were closing in. But the border - and the Western world - were in reach./nTwo months earlier, the 26-year-old claims he deserted from the Russian mercenaries, the Wagner Group. He was about to become the first of their troops to defect to the West./nThe specific claims of his apparent escape from Russia to Norway cannot be corroborated./nFounded in 2014, the Wagner Group is run by the businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin. It is believed to make up about 10% of Russia's forces in Ukraine, and has conducted operations in Syria, Libya and Mali./nThe group, and its often inhumane methods, are now internationally known. But information about how it operates - and how it is funded - has remained behind a veil of secrecy. Medvedev's escape could allow Western intelligence officers to tear that veil away./nWhy he chose to defect through Norway is unclear. The frozen tundra where Russia meets Nato is one of the most heavily guarded border regions in the world./nWatchtowers, staffed with soldiers, have strong searchlights to break through the winter Arctic gloom. Teams on both sides mount regular patrols./nBut in a video released by the Russian human rights group Gulagu.net, the former Wagner commander recalls sneaking past those watchtowers. All the while, he claims, the Russian troops hunting him were gaining ground./nAt around 2am local time on Friday, Medvedev says, he finally scrambled over the barbed wire guarding the Norwegian border as Russian guards closed in./nAs he climbed, he says he could hear dogs behind him. And, as spotlights from the guard towers picked him up, the shrill whistle of Russian bullets shot past him, he claims./nAfter scrambling past the wire, Medvedev ran towards a forest - the Norwegian forest - in the hope of finding someone to help him./nMoving through the woodland, Medvedev says he saw lights from a small settlement in the distance - around two kilometres away. He ran toward the light./nHe was too afraid to look behind him, he says, scared the dogs pursuing him had also navigated the fence./nHe banged on the first door he came to. After pleading with locals in broken English to call the authorities, he was detained by Norwegian border guards./nHis journey - from soldier in Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, to the relative safety of the West - was over./nBefore his arrival in, and defection from Ukraine, Medvedev had not lived a particularly unusual life./nAfter serving a brief period in the Russian army - as almost all 18-year-olds must - he was jailed for a short period in around 2017, Gulagu.net founder Vladimir Osechkin told the BBC. His offence is not known, although some reports say it was theft./nBut it was Russia's violent invasion of Ukraine that changed his life./nAs the conflict approached stalemate, and Russia tried to fill the gaps created by mounting casualties, the Wagner Group started to recruit heavily./nMedvedev, likely induced by the prospect of a steady wage, signed a four-month contract on 6 July until 6 November. Wagner recruits are reportedly paid around $10,000 (£8,186) per month, far more than the standard Russian salary./nAs a man with previous military experience, Medvedev was appointed a unit commander in the eastern Donbas region./nMr Osechkin told the BBC that Wagner supplied Medvedev with about 30-40 troops per week, many of them convicts recruited from Russian prisons./nMuch of the most intense fighting in Ukraine in the past six months has occurred in the Donbas, and Wagner is believed to be heavily involved in two of the bloodiest battles - in Soledar and Bakhmut./nMedvedev's lawyer in Norway, Brynjulf Risnes, told the BBC that Medvedev witnessed a host of war crimes - including seeing ""deserters being executed"" by the Wagner Group's internal security service./nAnd Mr Osechkin said Medvedev decided to leave Wagner after witnessing the group's ""terroristic methods""./n""He gave to me testimony about what he saw in the war,"" he said, ""and how the special forces of Wagner Group kill Russians who don't want to fight against Ukraine.""/nIn November 2022, Medvedev was told that, despite completing his four-month contract, the group had decided unilaterally to extend his service. It was unclear for how long./nThis seems to have been the final straw for Medvedev. ""In short he felt betrayed and wanted to leave as soon as possible,"" Mr Risnes told the BBC./nAfter fleeing Ukraine and returning to Russia, Medvedev entered a Wagner recruiting centre in the Russian city of St Petersburg where he returned his dog tags. This appears to have attracted the group's attention./n""When he left Wagner Group, the security office of Wagner did a lot of things to find him and he was at risk of dying,"" Mr Osechkin said./nWith security agents searching for him, Medvedev was forced to go into hiding to avoid the brutal kind of retribution he had seen the group impose upon deserters in Ukraine./nIt was at this point that he approached Gulagu.net - an exiled human rights organisation - for help./n""When he was at risk of dying, his friend wrote a letter to Gulagu and to me, to help save Andrey's life,"" he added. ""We did something then to help him to leave Russia.""/nAfter attempting to cross twice into Finland, Medvedev travelled to Russia's far north and made the passage across the Norwegian border./nAs the story broke on Monday, Wagner chief Mr Prigozhin issued a sarcastic statement claiming Medvedev is a Norwegian citizen who led a non-existent unit from the Scandinavian nation./nA picture of Medvedev's passport shared with the BBC showed he is indeed a Russian citizen from a village in the central province of Tomsk./nMr Risnes told the BBC he believes the former mercenary had taken some evidence of war crimes with him to Norway, and that he intends to share his information with groups investigating war crimes./nWhile the value of Medvedev's testimony could prove valuable to future war crimes investigators, it is likely to be Western spies who are truly excited to get their hands on the mercenary./nHis experiences, and his part in Russia's bloody invasion, could help shed light on the group's operations around the world./nBut for now, Medvedev remains in custody in the Oslo area, waiting to hear the outcome of his asylum application - far away from the conflict that changed his life, and shot his name into the headlines./n© 2023 BBC.

"By Chiagozie Nwonwu, Fauziyya Tukur, and Yemisi Oyedepo",Nigeria elections 2023: How influencers are secretly paid by political parties,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-63719505,"/nA BBC investigation has discovered that political parties in Nigeria are secretly paying social media influencers to spread disinformation about their opponents ahead of general elections in February./nThe BBC's Global Disinformation Team has spoken to whistle-blowers working for two of Nigeria's political parties, and prominent influencers who have described it as ""an industry""./nThe whistle-blowers say parties give out cash, lavish gifts, government contracts and even political appointments for their work./nWe changed their names to protect their identity. ""Yemi"" is a prominent strategist and ""Godiya"" a politician./n""We've paid an influencer up to 20m naira ($45,000; £37,000) for delivering a result. We've also given people gifts. Other people prefer to hear: 'What do you want to do in government, be a board member, be a special assistant?',"" says Godiya./nSituation rooms are commonplace in the run-up to an election. It's where political parties strategise, develop plans and monitor their campaigns' success. But in the rooms the whistle-blowers described to us, there was another function: following how false narratives assigned to influencers were performing./nStrategist Yemi says fake stories are developed to improve their candidates' chances: ""You can deliberately misinform in a suitable way for you.""/nThe BBC has spoken to multiple influencers who have confirmed that payment in exchange for false political posts is widespread./nOne influencer who asked not to be named - with almost 150,000 Facebook followers - told us he is paid by political parties to post completely false stories about political opponents. He says he does not do it openly but rather plants false stories through other micro-influencers he hires./nSeparately, Rabi'u Biyora is a major influencer known for supporting the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) party./nHe told us he was ""wooed"" by an opposition party to stop promoting the APC's candidate, and give his support to their candidate instead./nPosts on his Facebook timeline confirm he did just that. He told us he did not receive gifts of any kind to do so. But we discovered a Facebook post from 2019 in which he said he received a car and money from a party in exchange for his support on social media./nWe put this finding to him, but he stopped responding to us./nWith an estimated 80 million Nigerians online, social media plays a huge role in national debates about politics. Our investigation uncovered different tactics used to reach more people on Twitter. Many play on divisive issues such as religious, ethnic and regional differences./nIn July, influencers widely shared posts associating Kashim Shettima, the APC's candidate for vice-president, with members of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram./nThis false narrative gained momentum on Twitter and was shared thousands of times, spilling onto WhatsApp and other platforms./nUsing reverse image search, we found that those in the picture with Mr Shettima were nomadic Fulani parents whose children he had enrolled in secular schools in 2017, not members of Boko Haram./nA month later, influencers promoted a claim without evidence that Labour Party presidential candidate Peter Obi was linked to, and following orders from, the Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob) - a separatist movement designated in Nigeria as a terror group. His party denies this./nThose who shared this information included Reno Omokri - special assistant to former opposition President Goodluck Jonathan - who has more than two million followers on Twitter./nWhen approached for a comment, Reno Omokri said he stands by his accusations, but insists he has not been paid by the main opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) to campaign on their behalf./nMeanwhile, false claims that the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, fell ill and was rushed out of the country have been shared several times on Twitter./nGodiya, the politician we interviewed, says political parties tell influencers to elicit as much emotion as they can with their paid posts./n""We use images that may not even be relevant to the story we are trying to spin. We can take pictures from East Africa in the 1990s in warzones and attach them to a tweet about how my ethnic group is being killed. When people get emotional they retweet, they like, and it gets traction,"" she says./nAccording to the whistle-blowers, the hired influencers are sometimes given an idea that they should frame in their own words. At other times, they are given the actual tweets that need to be published at specific times./nThey say influencers are paid based on the number of followers they have. They also say payment happens mostly in cash to avoid a paper trail./nIt is not illegal for political parties to hire social media influencers in Nigeria, but spreading disinformation on social media is a breach of the country's laws and Twitter's policy./nThe BBC has asked Nigeria's main political parties, APC, PDP, and the Labour Party, about the whistle-blowers' allegations. They did not reply to our request for comment./nIn response to our findings, Twitter has taken down some of the accounts we reported to them and said it had a responsibility to protect electoral conversations from interference, manipulation, and false information./nHowever, there are concerns about the platform's capacity to tackle misinformation in Africa after Elon Musk's takeover of the company, when its continental headquarters in Ghana was closed and nearly all its staff fired./nThe BBC has reached out to Twitter again after these changes, but received no response./nIdayat Hassan, director at the Centre for Democracy and Development, says the activities of these influencers amounted to ""political interference""./n""It is undermining trust in democracy, undermining trust in the electoral system, and it is instigating conflict,"" she says./nBut politician Godiya sees it a different way, and defends the tactic: ""It is a game. Somebody had to win, and God help me, I will not be on the losing side.""/n© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.
